## 👥 User Roles

1. **Students**
   - View AI-generated lecture summaries
   - Check and track personal attendance

2. **Lecturers**
   - Use voice commands to control utilities (e.g., lights/projector modes)
   - Monitor attendance via smart door with motion detection

3. **PPH Technicians**
   - Remotely monitor and control classroom utilities
   - Receive system status updates and manage power usage
